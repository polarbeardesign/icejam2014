</div>
<p>A recording device captured the river gorging at the Ennis bridge on Friday, December 6, 2013 at 3:30 am.</p>

<h2>Was there a winner?</h2>

<p>There was not a winner, as no one purchased the 3:00-3:59 am time slot for Friday, December 6, 2013.
This means, half of the proceeds raised will roll-over to the next year's Ice Jam fundraiser proceeds.
$500 will be the proceed "seed" money for ICE JAM 2014.</p>

<h2>Was ICE JAM successful?</h2>

<p>Yes, new fundraising concepts often take time to catch on and we welcome the community's feedback.</p>

<p>The Foundation has posted a quick on-line survey at <a href="http://www.mvmcf.org">www.mvmcf.org</a> to obtain the community's feedback whether you participated or not in the ICE JAM fundraiser this year. In gathering feedback, the Foundation can evaluate and adjust the fundraiser accordingly to make next year's ICE JAM fundraiser even better. The Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation thanks everyone in the community for their impeccable generosity and continued support of our mission. The generosity of all our donors helps us do more, so that when members of the community need care, the Madison Valley Medical Center is able to provide local affordable health care and comprehensive medical services.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation, a non-profit corporation, has created an on-line fundraising raffle called "Ice Jam" where time slots are sold to predict the date and time within one hour, that the Madison River will ice gorge - for the first time - at the Ennis Bridge, located just south of downtown Ennis, MT.</p>

<p>The one individual who purchases the correct date and time within the hour that the Madison River ice gorges will win-half of the proceeds raised at Ice Jam! The Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation will retain the other half of the proceeds raised.</p>

<p>$20 buys a 1-hour time slot. You may purchase as many slots as you wish. The odds of winning are based on the total number of time slots sold and climatological activity.</p>
<a name="tocs"></a>
<p>If no one purchases the winning time slot and/or if the Madison River does not ice gorge at the Ennis Bridge, the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation will retain half of the proceeds raised and the other half of the proceeds raised will roll-over to the following year's Ice Jam fundraiser proceeds.</p>
